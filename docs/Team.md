# Team

# The Team Object ### Description The `Team` object is used to represent a Team within a company. `Employee` objects are often grouped this way. Note that in the Merge HRIS API, company subdivisions are all represented with `Teams`, rather than `Teams` and `Departments`.  ### Usage Example If you're building a way to filter by `Team`, you'd hit the `GET Teams` endpoint to fetch the `Teams`, and then use the `ID` of the team your user selects to filter the `GET Employees` endpoint.
